Visual Studio – Show Whitespace Characters
===========

Coming from coding in an environment where the whitespaces matter (i.e. makefiles and python), I became accustomed to showing all of the whitespace characters because I needed a quick and easy way to figure out why these files weren’t working.

In Visual Studio, there is also a setting that will allow you to do that.  There are two different ways to get at it:
File Menus 
Edit
Advanced
View White Space
Keyboard Shortcut 
CTRL+R, CTRL+W

Once done, you will start to see a “dash” in the middle of the line for spaces or an arrow in the middle of the line for tabs.

{{ Picture here }}

This is also super handy for tracking down rogue spaces at the end of a line.
