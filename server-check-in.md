Server Check In
===========

I recently found a great tool that will help you not only keep track of, but keep you informed when a server that you use becomes unaccessible.

The tool: https://servercheck.in

I bought the $15 dollar package when I heard about it on {{ LowEndTalk }} just to see what it did because I was curious and now, I'm glad that I did because it brings so much insight.

What does it do?

Polls your site every 10 (5 if you have the premium account) minutes for one of the following:
   - Website - HTTP/HTTPS 200 OK
   - Website - HTTP/HTTPS Content
   - Server - Basic Ping

If your site is unavailable on the requested method, you immediately get an email (or a text message) saying that your site is down.  The application will then continue to monitor your site's status and let you know as soon as the site has become accessible again.  Once the server is back up, you will get one last email saying that your server is back up and how long it was actually down for.

This helps to alleviate the burden of the manual check to see if your site is still up, and will set you up for success if you send in a support ticket.

On the website, you can even see how much downtime was actually experienced over the last 30 days.  What does that buy you?  The ability to go to your hosting company who (for the most part) say that you will have 99.9% uptime, and give them proof that their SLA has not been met (in my case I currently have a 99.03% uptime for this blog).

If that was all it did, it would be useful however, there is more that it does!

Each time that it hits your site, it keeps track of network latency (time delay in getting to the site) and will report it in a graph which can be useful to see.

In short, it's a great tool that I am glad I ended up buying because it gives great insights.
