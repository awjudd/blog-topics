Sites that allow you to format code/XML cleanly with the press of a button
===========

Recently I had to go through a process of debugging some dynamic SQL that was based off of some XML string that was being provided to a stored procedure.  Because both of these were generated dynamically, the code ended up being all on one line, which made it virtually impossible to debug (the string was 1000+ characters long).

In order to make it easier, I found some tools online that generated clean code.

Hopefully these tools will help in the future.
